        <p>  Well she's walking through the clouds
          With a circus mind that's running wild
          Butterflies and zebras
          And moonbeams and a fairy tale
          That's all she ever thinks about
          Riding the wind</p>

        <p>  When i'm sad she comes to me
          With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
          It's alright she says... it's alright
          Take anything you want from me
          Anything
          Fly on little wing
          Yeah, yeah, yeah
          Fly on little wing</p>
